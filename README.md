How to use:
Upon opening the title page, the user can either play the game, view the statistics, or exit the application.

Clicking play will allow the user to select the gamemode they want to play in.
The player can either play singleplayer (against an AI player) or two-player.

Gameplay:
- Click in a column to make a move in said column.
- If playing against the AI, the AI will automatically make a move afterwards.
- Gameplay continues until either the AI or the player gets four pieces in a row or there are no winners and the board is full (resulting in a tie).

Game Over:
- When a game ends, the player can either choose to play again, review the board, or exit to the title.
- If playing against the AI, the statistics against the AI will be shown.
- Playing again will start a new game with the same gamemode as before.
- Reviewing the game will show the previous game board with the winning pieces highlighted.
